# Voicemenu Generator
A generator made for custom voicemenus for TF2, but may work for other games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

This is the development branch. It has unstable versions of the source code, but if you want new features as soon as possible, or want to help out with fixing bugs, this is where to go.

If you are on a non-windows OS, use the [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page) program to run the generator. If your OS does not support 32-bit programs (e.g MacOS Catalina), then you should use a Virtual Machine with Windows or the Bootcamp software that comes with MacOS.

# Tested Games

## Team Fortress 2

Original testing environment. Works flawlessly.

## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

Pages do not run properly and I am having issues with captions.

Any source games that I left out are untested. If you encounter issues while using this program on a specific page, then make an issue on what issues you encountered and if it is possible to fix.s]
