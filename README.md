# Voicemenu Generator
A generator for custom voicemenus for TF2, but may work for other games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

If you are on a non-windows OS, use [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page). If your OS does not support 32-bit programs, you should use a Virtual Machine with Windows or Bootcamp.

# Tested Games

## Team Fortress 2

Original testing environment. Works flawlessly.

## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

Pages do not run properly and I am having issues with captions.

Any source games that I left out are untested. If you encounter issues while using this program on a specific page, make an issue!
