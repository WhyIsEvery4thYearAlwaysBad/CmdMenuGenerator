# Voicemenu Generator
A generator for custom voicemenus for TF2, but may work for other games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

This is the development branch. Unstable, but if you want new features as soon as possible, or want to help out with fixing bugs, this is where to go.

If you are on a non-windows OS, use [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page). If your OS does not support 32-bit programs, you should use a Virtual Machine with Windows or Bootcamp.
