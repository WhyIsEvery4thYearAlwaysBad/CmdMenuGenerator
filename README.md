# Voicemenu Generator
A generator for custom voicemenus for TF2, but may work for other games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

If you don't trust me, you can compile the source from master. Use the dev branch for in development features.

If you are on a non-windows OS, use [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page). Catalina-and-above users should use a Virtual Machine with Windows or Bootcamp.
