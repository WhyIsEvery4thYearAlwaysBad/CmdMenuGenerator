# Voicemenu Generator
A generator for custom voicemenus for games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

This is the development branch, so the source code may be unstable. If you want a stable version, go to the master branch.

# Tested Games

## Team Fortress 2

Original testing environment. Works flawlessly.

## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

Generated voicemenus themselves work, but only if you write them *directly* to the cfg folder. I am having issues with captions.

## Counter-Strike: Source

Untested.

## Left 4 Dead

Untested.

## Left 4 Dead 2

Untested.

## Portal

Untested.

## Portal 2

Untested.
