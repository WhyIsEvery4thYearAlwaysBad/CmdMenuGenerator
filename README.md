# Voicemenu Generator
A generator made for custom voicemenus for TF2, but may work for other games made in the Source Engine. Refer to the Introduction wiki for more information.

If you are on a non-WinNT OS then use the [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) program to run the generator. If your OS does not support [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) (MacOS Catalina), then use a Virtual Machine with Windows or the Bootcamp software that comes with MacOS.

This is the development branch. It has unstable versions of the source code, but if you want new features as soon as possible, or want to help out with fixing bugs, this is where to go.

<sup>[1]</sup> - Compiled voicemenus must be written directly to the csgo/cfg folder to function. (Do this by compiling to the csgo folder.)

<sup>[2]</sup> - The page will not display if a page was not already opened.

Any source games that I left out are untested. If you encounter issues while using this program, then make an issue on what issues you encountered and if it is possible to fix.
