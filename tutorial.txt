How to Use:
cvm_generate.exe <filename> <launch options>
Launch Options:
⦁ -config - If set, will print the class overrides to console, rather than write to class cfgs.
⦁ -o= - Output directory. This is where the files will go. Must be a valid path. (Default path is "./customvoicemenu")
⦁ /? - Opens help dialog.
Run this in a terminal, because you will get output. Note that this program does have error detection, but it is bad.

	Syntax (In Psuedo-BNF Notation)
———————————————————————————————————————
<key-value> ::= <key : identifier> "=" <value : string> ; Set a key to the specified value. (e.g #cvm.resetkeys="bind 69 420")
<page> ::= <title : string> "{" (<bind> | <toggle-bind> | <page>) "}" ; A collection of binds. (e.g "Voicelines" { ... })
<bind> ::= "BIND" <title : string> <cmdstr : string> "|" ; A key that when pressed, runs the command string. (e.g BIND "AmongUsIsCringe" "say Among Us is bad." |)
<toggle-bind> ::= "TOGGLE" "BIND" <title : string> <cmdstr : string> [, <title : string> <cmdstr : string>…] "|" ; - A bind with multiple states. (e.g TOGGLE BIND "Enable AiMBoT" "cl_aimbot 1" "Disable aaAiMBoOt" "cl_aimbot 0" | )
; NOTE:
⦁ titles (<title>) should be written as caption strings (strings that use the source caption language). 
⦁ strings (<string>) will never carry double quotes by default.
⦁ After 10 binds in a page, newer binds begin to override the older ones. (e.g If you had the twelfth (12th) bind "rip r/tf2", you would not be able to use the first (1st) bind.)
⦁ Any title formatted will change the following from their unformatted counter parts:
	⦁ Caption tags, punctuation, and non-ascii characters are removed.
	⦁ Uppercase letters become lowercase.
	⦁ Spaces ( ) are replaced with underscores (_).
For example, If the page name was "[Random Crit Binds]", the cfg file found would be "random_crit_binds".

Example Voicemenu: 
#cvm.italicizebydefault = "true"
	"root" {
		"Messages" {
		TOGGLE "<clr:100,255,100>Random crit bind."	"say Random crits are fair and balanced." "Random crit bind." "say Random Crits are great!" "Random crit bind." "say Random Crits are- ok this joke is getting old." |
		"Selling Diamonds." "say Come up Come up! I'm selling a strange killstreak Your Eternal Reward!"
		"<B>Mining Diamonds<B>" "say Hey LoOK gUYs I'm MinIng fOR DIamoNDs!"
		}
		"POOTIS" "voicemenu 1 4"
	}

	Compiling and Running
—————————————————————————————
To compile your voicemenu, put the filepath as a parameter to cvm_generate.exe. When compiling your voicemenu, the pages will be saved as cfgs with the filenames being formatted. After it has compiled, compile the captions. (It is technically usable at this point. However, I recommend compiling the output folder with the cfgs to a vpk, to reduce load times.)
To actually open a voicemenu, you have to set the current menu with "exec cvm.menu=<formatted menu name>". After that, you can use +cvm.openmenu to open the menu. To exit it, simply run "cvm.exitmenu". For instance, to open the "|Taglines|" menu, bind a key to an ±alias with "exec cvm.menu=taglines" and +cvm.openmenu, and set the -alias to run -cvm.opemenu. 
End result:
	alias +open_menu_taglines "exec cvm.menu=taglines; +cvm.openmenu"
	alias -open_menu_taglines "-cvm.openmenu"
	bind <KEY> +open_menu_taglines
Note that if duplicate page names are found after being formatted, it will have a number appended to it, indicating the order with the first not having a number at all.
For example:
⦁ If "Music" was used as a page name three times. The Pages would be music, music_1, and music_2 respectively.
⦁ If there pages "<clr:100,255,100>SPAM", "<B>SPAM<B>", and "<I>[SPAM]<I>", they would be named "spam", "spam_1", and "spam_2" respectively.

	Key Value Reference
———————————————————————————
⦁ #cvm.boldbydefault - If set to true, will bold all pages with <B>. As a result, <B> in titles will unbolden the selected characters. Note that the number key prepended will not be effected by this trick. Default value is "false".
⦁ #cvm.italicizebydefault - If set to true, will italicize all entries with <I>. As a result, <I> in titles will unitalicize the selected characters. Note that the number key prepended will not be effected by this trick. Default value is "false".
⦁ #cvm.defaultcolor - Color tag that is inserted into every caption. To change a title's color insert the <clr> tag. Note that the number key prepended will not be effected by any <clr> tags. Default value is "".
⦁ #cvm.resetkeys - Command-String Alias that runs after selecting a bind. Default value is "bind 1 slot1; bind 2 slot2; bind 3 slot3; bind 4 slot4; bind 5 slot5; bind 6 slot6; bind 7 slot7; bind 8 slot8; bind 9 slot9; bind 0 slot10".
⦁ #cvm.resetkeys.<classname> - Alias that runs only after selecting a bind if you are the specified class. Default value is "".
⦁ #cvm.predisplay_time - cc_predisplay_time ran after exiting menu. Key Value determines the cvar value. Default value is "0.25".
⦁ #cvm.linger_time - cc_linger_time ran after exiting menu. Key Value determines the cvar value. Default value is "0".

	Bugs
————————————
⦁ If using more than 1 key to activate different menus, when one of them has already been pressed, it takes two presses to actually activate the menu. (There is a fix, but it's poorly implemented.)
⦁ Captions don't compile correctly the first time, after compiling an edited voicemenu file.
